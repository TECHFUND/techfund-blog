## Introduction
A smart contract audit is an important step in the development of any blockchain-based project. It ensures that the smart contract code is secure, efficient, and free of errors. In this blog post, we will explore some of the different types of tools that are commonly used for smart contract audits, and discuss their negative features.

## Mythril
One popular tool for smart contract audits is Mythril. Mythril is a static analysis tool that uses symbolic execution to find vulnerabilities in smart contracts. While it is effective at identifying a wide range of security issues, it has the disadvantage of being computationally expensive, which can make it impractical for auditing large or complex smart contracts.

To install Mythril, you will need to have Python 3.5 or later installed on your system. You can check which version of Python you have installed by running the following command:

	python --version

If you do not have Python installed, or if you have an older version, you can download and install the latest version from the Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can install Mythril using pip, a package manager for Python. To install Mythril using pip, run the following command:

	pip install mythril

This will download and install Mythril and all of its dependencies. After the installation is complete, you can verify that Mythril is installed and working by running the following command:

	myth --version

This should print the version number of Mythril, indicating that it is installed and ready to use.

## Oyente
Another commonly used tool is Oyente. Oyente is a symbolic execution tool that uses constraint solving to detect potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It is fast and efficient, but it has limited capabilities and may not be able to find all potential vulnerabilities in a smart contract.

To install Oyente, you will need to have Python 2.7 or later and pip, a package manager for Python, installed on your system. You can check which version of Python you have installed by running the following command:

	python --version

If you do not have Python installed, or if you have an older version, you can download and install the latest version from the Python website.

Once you have Python and pip installed, you can install Oyente using the following command:

	pip install oyente

This will download and install Oyente and all of its dependencies. After the installation is complete, you can verify that Oyente is installed and working by running the following command:

	oyente --version

This should print the version number of Oyente, indicating that it is installed and ready to use. It is very important to keep updating the tools to latest versions.

## Manticore
A third tool that is often used for smart contract audits is Manticore. Manticore is a dynamic analysis tool that uses symbolic execution to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It is effective at finding a wide range of security issues, but it is slow and can be impractical for auditing large or complex smart contracts.

In conclusion, while there are many different tools available for smart contract audits, each has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to carefully consider which tool is best suited for a given project, taking into account the size and complexity of the smart contract, as well as the specific security concerns that need to be addressed.
